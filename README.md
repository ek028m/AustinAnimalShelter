# AustinAnimalShelter
A data analysis / visualization project to shed light into the Animal Shelter Outcomes Dataset in Austin, TX.

Animal Center Outcomes from Oct, 1st 2013 to present. Outcomes represent the status of animals as they leave the Animal Center. All animals receive a unique Animal ID during intake. Annually over 90% of animals entering the center, are adopted, transferred to rescue or returned to their owners. The Outcomes data set reflects that Austin, TX. is the largest "No Kill" city in the country.

## Project Scope
This is an open ended project to explore multiple questions and to investigate using multiple programming tools / languages.

#### Questions to Explore
1. What is the average length of time a dof remains in the center?
2. What type of distribution does the breeds follow?
3. Is there a correlation between the outcome type and breed?
4. Does the dog age affect the outcome type?

#### Programming Tools / Languages to Explore
1. Retrieve the animal shelter data using API
2. Clean the data with Python or R
3. Visualize the data with Python / R / Power BI
4. Act upon the visualizations into deeper analysis / potentially building models with Python
